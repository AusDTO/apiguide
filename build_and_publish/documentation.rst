Document your API
=================

.. should::

   All APIs must include documentation targeted at the developer that will consume your API.

The best way to ensure that your API documentation is current and accurate is to embed it within your API implementation and then generate the documentation using literate programming techniques, or a framework such as http://apidocjs.com/,  http://swagger.io/, or http://raml.org/index.html. 

There are a number of sites offering guidance on providing high quality API documentation:
