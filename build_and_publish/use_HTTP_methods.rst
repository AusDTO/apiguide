Use HTTP methods and status codes
=================================

HTTP methods and status codes should be used in compliance with their definitions under the HTTP/1.1 standard. Meaningful status codes helps consumers utilise your API.


.. this statement is clear to me, but might need better explanation

The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type being worked on and its current state.


.. Table 1: Example of HTTP methods  and response status codes

Examples
--------

      Host: example.gov.au
      Accept: application/json, text/javascript
   
   A response of "200 OK" indicating that the request has succeeded.
   
   .. sourcecode:: http
   
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Vary: Accept
      Content-Type: text/javascript

   A response of "201 Created" indicates that the request has been fulfilled.

   The URI of the new resource is provided in the response

   .. sourcecode:: http

HTTP response principles
------------------------

No values in keys – for example, {“125”: “Environment”} is bad, {“id”: “125”, “name”: “Environment”} is good. Note that in the first (bad) example, the key is "125" and the value is "Environment". This is a problem because the key is supposed to be the name of the value. In the second example (good) the keys are descriptions of their coresponding values.

No internal-specific names (for example, "node" and "taxonomy term")

Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set


Provide error responses
-----------------------

Error responses should be as descriptive and specific as possible. They should also include a message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined ID) and links where developers can find more information. For example:


.. sourcecode:: json

   {
     "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem.
		Provide developers suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
     "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
     "errorCode" : "444444",
     "moreInfo" : "http://api.example.gov/v1/documentation/errors/444444.html"
   }
