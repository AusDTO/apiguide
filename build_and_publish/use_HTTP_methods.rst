Use HTTP methods and status codes
=================================

HTTP methods and status codes should be used in compliance with their definitions under the HTTP/1.1 standard.

 * The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type being worked on and its current state.
 * Receiving meaningful status codes helps consumers better consume your API.

HTTP response principles

No values in keys â€“ for example, {"125": "Environment"} is bad, {"id": "125", "name": "Environment"} is good.

No internal-specific names (for example, "node" and "taxonomy term")

Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set

Provide error responses

Error responses should be as descriptive and specific as possible. They should also include a message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined ID) and links where developers can find more information. For example:

    {
      "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem. Provide developers
       suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
      "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
      "errorCode" : "444444",
      "moreInfo" : "http://api.example.gov/v1/documentation/errors/444444.html"
    }
