Privacy and security
====================

**Provide appropriate security and privacy**

The level of protection required for a specific API depends on a risk assessment of the consequences of an information leak.  Agencies must match each API to the relevant assurance level and then apply the controls recommended for that level.

It is very important to apply the right assurance level to each granular API operation.  Failure to do so can seriously impact user experience or service risk.

Guidance on the best practice usage of the OpenID Connect protocol for securing government API services that require NEAF assurance level 2 or 3 is provided in the Securing APIs guide. 

For peer-to-peer messaging using standards such as ebMS3/AS4, the same assurance level is achieved but with different protocols (WS-Security and SAML2.0).  

.. recommended::

   All APIs  should specify their assurance level and must apply the relevant controls.
