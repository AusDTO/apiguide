Developer empathy

**Design with developer empathy**

When it comes to APIs, developers are your users. The same principles of user-centred-design apply to the development and publication of APIs (simplicity, obviousness, fit-for-purpose etc).  Most of the other criteria in this guide are traceable to the principles of good design. Perhaps the most important criteria to be mindful of is *simplicity*: as with any other product, people simply won't use something if it is hard to use. 

Hard-to-use APIs create bad public policy outcomes:
- Potentially significant economic value will remain undiscovered or unrealised
- Secondary markets that form around APIs (e.g. automated tax reporting software) will be less competitive, and therefore less efficient (API complexity creates barriers to market entry) 

To ensure dicoverability and accountability, all Government APIs will be published to a central service register (as described in Building and Publishing APIs secion [insert link]).  The service register will give developers a mechanism to provide feedback on APIs.  An API that is consistently rated as hard to use will be deemed defective and should be remediated.

.. recommended::

   Less than 20% of feedback rates the API as hard to use.
