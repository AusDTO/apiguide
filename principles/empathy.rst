Developer empathy

**Design with developer empathy**

When it comes to APIs, developers are your users. The same principles of user-centred-design apply to the development and publication of APIs (simplicity, obviousness, fit-for-purpose etc).  Most of the other criteria in this guide are traceable to the principles of good design. Perhaps the most important criteria to be mindful of is *simplicity*: as with any other product, people simply won't use something if it is hard to use. 

Hard-to-use APIs create bad public policy outcomes:
 * Potentially significant economic value will remain undiscovered or unrealised
 * Secondary markets that form around APIs (e.g. automated tax reporting software) will be less competitive, and therefore less efficient (API complexity creates barriers to market entry) 


.. recommended::

   An API that is consistently rated as hard to use should be remediated. Ensure less than 20% of feedback rates the API as hard to use.
