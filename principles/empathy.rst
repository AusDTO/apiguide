Developer Empathy
=================

**Design with developer empathy**

Developers are users too and the same principles of user-centred-design apply to the development and publishing of APIs â€“ except that your user is a developer that wants to consume your API rather than an end user that is a customer for the government service or data.  Most of the other criteria in this guide are traceable to this criteria.  

All Government APIs will be published to a central service register as described in Building and publishing APis.  The service register will provide a mechanism for developers to provide feedback on APIs.  An API that is consistently rated as hard to use should be considered defective.

**Conformance Criteria:** less than 20% of feedback rates the API as poor.
