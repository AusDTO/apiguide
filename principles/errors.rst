Clear error messages
====================

**Provide useful error messages**

Graceful handling of failure conditions is an essential part of delivering a high quality API. Error messages should:

 * Conform to the standards relevant for the technology in use. 
 * Provide a human-readable error message that is designed to be read and understood by the user.
 * Include a technical diagnostic message that contains technical details for use by the application that is consuming the API.

Further information on error messaging for REST APIs is provided in the Build and publish APIs guidance.

**Conformance criteria:** No unexpected behaviour from any API in production release
