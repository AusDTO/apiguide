Documentation
=============

**Ensure APIs are discoverable and documented**

For APIs to be used, they must be discoverable and documented.  The single most important quality of APIs requested by developers is that they are well documented. Agencies must:

 * List their APIs on the DTO service registry. Detailed information on how to do this is provided on the Building and using APIs guidance.
 * Document all their APIs and provide a link to the documentation in the DTO service registry.  
 * Provide feedback and support channels for API users.

The best practice for documentation of APIs is to generate the documentation from the API itself so that there is always a precise alignment between the API and itâ€™s documentation.  Open source tools such as http://swagger.io/ provide simple means to document APIs.

**Conformance criteria:** All APIs are published, documented, and supported.
