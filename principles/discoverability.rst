Documentation
=============

**Ensure APIs are discoverable and documented**

For APIs to be used, they must be discoverable and documented.  Developers often cite the requirement for good documentation as the single most important quality of APIs.


.. recommended::

   Publish API documentation, and provide a link to the documentation from the API endpont.


.. recommended::

   Provide feedback and support channels for API users.


.. may::

   Consider using some sort of *literate system*  that generates the API documentation from
   API code (or vica verca), to ensure so that there is always a precise alignment between
   the API and itâ€™s documentation.


.. may::

   Consider using open source API specification tools such as http://swagger.io/, to simplify
   and standardise the means by which APIs are documented.


.. recommended::

   All APIs that are published should be adequately documented and supported by the agency
   that produces them.
